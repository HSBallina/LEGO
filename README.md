# LEGO
Assorted LEGO bricks for 3D printing.
## Background
Since the bricks exported from LDraw aren't smooth enough (or I suck at exporting) I started creating bricks I needed for my own projects. I will add bricks as I create new ones.
## Requests and contribution
Feel free to throw me a request if you're in need of a certan brick not yet created. Easiest way would be to create an issue and label it 'request'.

You're welcome to contribute to the library if you wish. I base the bricks on the dimensions in this sketch (with a few adjustments TBA):
